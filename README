# Introduction

This repository holds the basic code for interfacing with the Active Satellite Robot (ASR) from your laptop. It is there to serve a baseline for you to connect to the Arduino and control the motors of the robot. The repo will be updated throughout the week if new features are introduced or bugs are fixed.

## System overview

The robot's onboard computer (the Arduino Nano IOT) is a microcontroller running on C++ compiled code. It has a WiFi/Bluetooth module on it and that's what is used to connect to it. The Nano creates its own network to which the ground station (laptop running python is connected). The python script on the laptop then takes button presses from the user and transmits them as single characters which the Arduino then receives and triggers the corresponding functions.

# Installation Instructions

## Software Download

To edit, compile and run the code you will need two IDE environments. (In theory we could do only one, but it'll be easier if we use two separate ones).
- Arduino IDE
- VSCode (or any other python IDE like Spyder)

### Arduino IDE

To download Arduino IDE, use this link: https://www.arduino.cc/en/software/
If you're new to Arduino (then you're in for a treat!), follow this link for a basic getting-started guide: https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v2/tutorials/getting-started-ide-v2/

### VS Code

VS Code is a very popular developer software for all types of languages. If you already have an IDE ready, feel free to use it. If not, download VS Code from here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download.

Next, we need to install python and its dependencies (python add-ons), for this, we will use uv, which is a very versatile dependency manager. Open terminal in VS-Code and run the following line:
```
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```
